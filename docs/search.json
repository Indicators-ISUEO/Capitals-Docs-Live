    "text": "Overview\nIn our project, we seek to explore the relationship between community capital indicators and the overall condition of communities in Iowa, aiming to identify strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and gaps within these communities. The main work focuses on major events such as natural disasters, job losses, new job creation, school closures, and new opportunities for tourism and healthcare. The study seeks to identify the most relevant community capitals, trends over time, and the impact on community resiliency, by analyzing correlations between various indicators and comparing quantitative data with some qualitative insights.\nThat aside, we also seek to develop a comprehensive database of significant events, using sources such as the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN), Iowa Economic Development Authority Board minutes, and weather disaster summaries. The Data analysis will include exploring relationships within and between different community capitals, and visualizing findings using dashboards created in Shiny or Tableau. The overall goal is to provide a tool for stakeholders to better understand and enhance community resiliency and quality of life.\n\nProject Description\n\nProject Summary\nWhat do the community capital indicators tell us about a community? Community strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, gaps, etc.\nHow well do the identified indicators tell us about the condition of a community in relationship to the community capitals?\n\n\nProject Scope\n\nDatabase of major events in Iowa communities (natural disasters, plant closings/major job loss, new plant opening/jobs created, school closures/school district mergers, closure of state-run hospitals and nursing care facilities, new opportunities for tourism – music festival, bike trails, recreation, etc., opening of new hospitals/care facilities)\nData analysis:\n\nCorrelations between indicators – including relationship of indicators within and between capitals as well as with different peer groupings (population, RUCC)\nTrends and change over time.\nComparison to qualitative data and use as – visioning, RHRA, small towns poll.\nWhich three capitals are most related (ex: if interested in built capital – which two others might be most relevant to understanding built?)\n\nDashboard – tableau\nResiliency fit into capitals.\n\n\n\nDefinition of Success\nAt the conclusion of the DSPG program the project will deliver: - Database of major events in Iowa communities - R scripts with comments archived on GitHub – automated processes whenever possible - Use data from CED data team database when available. - Documented process descriptions for the follow-up non-DSPG phase - Dashboard to show findings and results from data analysis",

It is calculated by dividing the total number of such households by total households. A higher percentage of single-parent households may signal increased vulnerability in a community. These households often face greater financial stress, limited social support, and reduced capacity to respond to and recover from disasters. These challenges can negatively affect social capital and community resilience (Flanagan et al., 2011). #### Source\nACS Variables:\n\nS1101_C03_005\n\nMale householder, no spouse present, family household.

Long commutes are associated with reduced time and energy for civic engagement, local social connections, and participation in community life. Research suggests that extended commute times can negatively impact social capital by limiting individuals’ availability for volunteerism, neighborhood interaction, and community-based activities. These patterns may also affect workforce well-being and local economic vibrancy by decreasing worker satisfaction and retention (Besser et al., 2008).\n\n\nSource\nACS Variables:\n\nB08134_010 (# long-distance Commuters)\nB08134_001 (total commuters)\n\n\n\nCalculation\n\\[\\text{percent\\_long\\_commute} = \\frac{\\text{Long-distance commuters}}{\\text{Total Commuters}}\\]\n\n\n\nEnglish Proficiency (Social)\n\nMeasure Description\nThis indicator measures the proportion of residents who speak English “very well” or better, calculated by dividing the number of proficient English speakers by the total population. English proficiency is an essential component of a community’s ability to access information and services. Limited English proficiency can create barriers to health care, education, employment, and emergency communication. It is also a key component of social vulnerability in disaster contexts. Communities with a higher proportion of residents who speak English less than very well are more likely to experience adverse outcomes during emergencies due to difficulties understanding warnings, evacuation orders, and recovery information. Identifying these communities can support targeted interventions and improve resilience (Flanagan et al., 2011).\n\n\nSource\nACS Variables for residents who speak very good English:\n\nB06007_001\n\nResidents who are proficient in speaking English\n\nB06007_002\n\nResidents that only speak English\n\nB06007_004\n\nResidents that speak Spanish at home and speak English “very well”\n\nB06007_007 (Residents that speak other languages at home and speak English “very well”)\n\n\n\nCalculation\n\\[\\text{percent\\_english\\_proficiency} = \\frac{\\text{Sum Proficient}}{\\text{Total Residents}}\\]\n\n\n\nEmployments in agriculture, forestry, fishing, hunting, and mining (Natural)\n\nMeasure Description\nThis indicator measures the share of the civilian employed population working in agriculture, forestry, fishing, hunting, and mining industries. These industries, while important to rural economies, can be associated with lower levels of economic resilience. Natural resource dependence in rural counties is linked to decreased economic prosperity. Such communities often experience reduced investment in both individual and community human capital, including limited educational and workforce development opportunities. Overreliance on resource-based employment may also constrain long-term financial capital growth due to economic volatility and lower-wage job structures.

Higher education is a key driver of human and financial capital, contributing to innovation, income growth, and civic engagement. Research shows that skilled workers not only support economic growth but also influence policy decisions and increase demand for amenities and public goods. These dynamics can improve community quality of life, helping attract and retain additional high-skill workers, which in turn reinforces local prosperity (Fan et al., 2016).\n\n\nSource\nACS Variables:\n\nB25034_010 (Housing units built 1940 to 1949)\nB25034_009 (Housing units built 1950 to 1959)\nB25034_011 (Housing units built before 1940)\nB25034_001 (Total housing units)\n\n\n\nCalculation\nThe proportion of housing units built before 1960 is calculated by summing the housing units built up to 1959 and dividing by the total number of housing units.\n\n\n\nPercentage of occupied housing units (Built)\n\nMeasure Description\nThis indicator measures the share of occupied housing units, reflecting the level of property utilization in a community. Vacant and abandoned properties are often signs of disinvestment in the built environment and are associated with physical deterioration, increased crime, and reduced neighborhood vitality. As detailed by Roude et al. (2024), such vacancies can erode social ties, diminish perceived safety, and discourage economic activity. In contrast, higher occupancy supports financial capital through property value retention, fosters social capital via community engagement, and sustains the built environment as a foundation for well-being (Roude et al., 2024).\n\n\nSource\nACS Variables:\n\nDP04_0002P\n\nPercent of Occupied housing units\n\n\n\n\nCalculation\nThe proportion of occupied housing units is calculated by the percent of occupied units.\n\n\n\nPercentage of households with complete plumbing (Built)\n\nSource\nACS Variables:\n\nB25047_002 (# Facilities with complete plumbing)\nB25047_001 (Total plumbing facilities)\n\n\n\nMeasure Description & Calculation\nThe proportion of households with complete plumbing is calculated by dividing the number of facilities with complete plumbing by the total number of plumbing facilities.\n\\[\\text{prop\\_plumbing} = \\frac{\\text{Complete Plumbing}}{\\text{Total Plumbing}}\\]\n\n\n\nPercentage of households with a broadband subscription (Built)\n\nMeasure Description\nThis indicator measures the percentage of households with broadband internet subscriptions. Broadband is a key component of built capital that enables the development of human capital by supporting access to education, employment, and healthcare. According to Stritzel and LoPiccalo (2023), gaps in broadband availability—especially in rural areas—limit communities’ capacity to retain residents, attract employers, and foster income growth. Reliable internet is also essential for virtual learning and telehealth, both of which expand opportunities for individual advancement and community resilience (Valentín-Sívico et al., 2023).\n\n\nSource\nACS Variables:\n\nDP02_0154P\n\nPercent of total households with a broadband internet subscription\n\n\n\n\nCalculation\nThe percent of households with a broadband subscription is calculated by DP02_0154P.\n\n\n\nRace Diversity (Cultural)\n\nSource\nACS Variables:\n\nB03002_003 (Not Hispanic or Latino:!!White alone)\nB03002_004 (Not Hispanic or Latino:!!Black or African American alone)\nB03002_005 (Not Hispanic or Latino:!!American Indian and Alaska Native alone)\nB03002_006 (Not Hispanic or Latino:!!Asian alone)\nB03002_007 (Not Hispanic or Latino:!!Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander alone)\nB03002_008 (Not Hispanic or Latino:!!Some other race alone)\nB03002_009 (Not Hispanic or Latino:!!Two or more races)\nB03002_013 (Hispanic or Latino:!!White alone)\nB03002_014 (Hispanic or Latino:!!Black or African American alone)\nB03002_015 (Hispanic or Latino:!!American Indian and Alaska Native alone)\nB03002_016 (Hispanic or Latino:!!Asian alone)\nB03002_017 (Hispanic or Latino:!!Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander alone)\nB03002_018 (Hispanic or Latino:!!Some other race alone)\nB03002_019 (Hispanic or Latino:!!Two or more races)\n\n\n\nMeasure Description & Calculation\n\nDiversity in the distribution of different race across Iowa communities.\n\n\n\nSimpson Index\n\\[D = 1 - \\left( \\frac{\\sum n(n-1)}{N(N-1)} \\right)\\]\nWhere:\n• n = the total number of organisms of a particular species\n• N = the total number of organisms of all species\nInterpretation: Simpson’s Diversity Index is a measure of diversity which takes into account the number of species present, as well as the relative abundance of each species. As species richness and evenness increase, so diversity increases. It is also the probability of picking two random individuals which are not of the same group.\n\n\nRace Diversity\nWith different groups of race taken from ACS, we calculate the Simpson Index to measure the diversity, using the above formula.\n\n\n\nHealth Insurance Coverage (Human)\n\nMeasure Description\nThis indicator measures the percentage of the population with health insurance. Lack of health insurance is associated with poorer health outcomes and higher mortality rates. Research shows that uninsured individuals often face significant barriers to essential care, particularly in managing chronic diseases. Uninsured patients with conditions like cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease often have more advanced disease at diagnosis, receive lower-quality care, and experience higher mortality rates both during hospitalization and after discharge. Health insurance coverage improves access to preventive services and essential care, leading to better health outcomes (Woolhandler & Himmelstein, 2017).\n\n\nSource\nACS Variables:\n\nS2701_C03_001\n\nPercent of civilian non-institutionalized population with health insurance\n\n\n\n\nCalculation\n\nMeasure taken directly from S2701_C03_001\n\n\n\n\nBachelor’s Degree Attainment (Human)\n\nMeasure Description\nThis indicator measures the share of the population aged 25 and older who have earned a bachelor’s degree or higher. Higher education is a key driver of human and financial capital, contributing to innovation, income growth, and civic engagement. Research shows that skilled workers not only support economic growth but also influence policy decisions and increase demand for amenities and public goods. These dynamics can improve community quality of life, helping attract and retain additional high-skill workers, which in turn reinforces local prosperity (Fan et al., 2016).\n\n\nSource\nACS Variables:\n\nS1501_C02_015\n\nPercent of 25+ population with at least a bachelor’s degree\n\n\n\n\nCalculation\n\nMeasure taken directly from S1501_C02_015\n\n\n\n\nHigh School Degree Attainment (Human)\n\nMeasure Description\nThis indicator measures the percentage of the population aged 25 and older who have completed a high school diploma or equivalent. Educational attainment at this level is a foundational component of human capital and supports workforce participation and local economic stability. Communities with higher education levels tend to experience faster employment growth. A better-educated population is more likely to engage in civic life, support public services, and contribute to a more adaptable and productive labor force (Fan et al., 2016).\n\n\nSource\nACS Variables:\n\nS1501_C02_014\n\nPercent of 25+ population with at least a high school degree (or equivalent)\n\n\n\n\nCalculation\n\nMeasure taken directly from S1501_C02_014\n\n\n\n\nSenior Dependency Ratio (Human)\n\nSource\nACS Variables:\n\nS0101_C02_030\n\nPercent of population that is 65 years of age and over\n\nS0101_C02_022\n\nPercent of population that is under 18 years of age\n\n\n\n\nMeasure Description & Calculation\n\\[\\text{pct\\_18\\_64 = 100 - (pct\\_under\\_18\\ +\\ pct\\_65\\_plus)}\\] \\[\\text{dep\\_ratio\\_senior} = \\frac{\\text{pct\\_65\\_plus}}{\\text{pct\\_18\\_64}}\\]\n\n\n\nChild Dependency Ratio (Human)\n\nSource\nACS Variables:\n\nS0101_C02_030\n\nPercent of population that is 65 years of age and over\n\nS0101_C02_022\n\nPercent of population that is under 18 years of age\n\n\n\n\nMeasure Description & Calculation\n\\[\\text{pct\\_18\\_64 = 100 - (pct\\_under\\_18\\ +\\ pct\\_65\\_plus)}\\] \\[\\text{dep\\_ratio\\_child} = \\frac{\\text{pct\\_under\\_18}}{\\text{pct\\_18\\_64}}\\]\n\n\n\nDependency Ratio (Human)\n\nSource\nACS Variables:\n\nS0101_C02_030\n\nPercent of population that is 65 years of age and over\n\nS0101_C02_022\n\nPercent of population that is under 18 years of age\n\n\n\n\nMeasure Description & Calculation\n\\[\\text{dep\\_ratio} = \\text{Senior Dependency Ratio + Child Dependency Ratio}\\]\n\n\n\nPoverty Rate (Financial)\n\nSource\nACS Variables:\n\nS1701_C03_001\n\nPercent population for whom poverty status is determined with income below the federal poverty line in the last 12 months\n\n\n\n\nMeasure Description & Calculation\n\nMeasure taken directly from S1701_C03_001\n\n\n\n\nLabor Force Participation Rate (Population 16+) (Financial)\n\nMeasure Description\nThis indicator measures the percentage of the population aged 16 and older actively participating in the labor force. Lack of labor force participation in this group is associated with lower well-being and can lead to diminished human and financial capital. Research shows that individuals who are unemployed or out of the labor force report lower life satisfaction and higher negative affect. However, they tend to have a more optimistic outlook about their future. When individuals of this age group are not engaged in the labor force, they may experience reduced economic opportunities, impacting both their financial capital and overall life satisfaction (Graham & Pinto, 2021).\n\n\nSource\nACS Variables:\n\nS2301_C02_001\n\nLabor force participation rate for population 16 or older\n\n\n\n\nCalculation\n\nMeasures taken directly from S2301_C02_001 and S2301_C02_021\n\n\n\n\nLabor Force Participation Rate (Population 20-64) (Financial)\n\nMeasure Description\nThis indicator measures the percentage of individuals aged 20 to 64 who are actively participating in the labor force. For this age group, lack of labor force participation is strongly tied to lower health outcomes and reduced human capital. Research indicates that people within this age range who are unemployed have significantly lower life satisfaction compared to those employed, though they remain optimistic about their future. The financial implications of unemployment for this group are considerable, as it reduces both income opportunities and social mobility, ultimately impacting their long-term economic stability (Graham & Pinto, 2021).\n\n\nSource\nACS Variables:\n\nS2301_C02_021\n\nLabor force participation rate for population aged 20 to 64\n\n\n\n\nCalculation\n\nMeasures taken directly from S2301_C02_001 and S2301_C02_021\n\n\n\n\nUnemployment Rate (Financial)\n\nMeasure Description\nThis indicator measures the percentage of the population aged 16 and older who are unemployed. Unemployment is associated with both poorer psychological health and reduced financial capital. Research shows that unemployed individuals experience significantly more distress and lower well-being than those who are employed. Employment contributes to mental health by providing structure, social contact, purpose, and status; its absence often leads to deteriorated psychological well-being (Paul & Moser, 2009). Financially, unemployment can limit a household’s ability to maintain income and savings, contributing to greater economic vulnerability over time (Gruber, 2000).\n\n\nSource\nACS Variables:\n\nS2301_C04_001\n\nUnemployment rate for the population 16 or older\n\n\n\n\nCalculation\n\nMeasure taken directly from S2301_C04_001\n\n\n\n\nMedian Household Income (Financial)\n\nMeasure Description\nThis indicator measures the median income of households. Median household income is a key component of financial capital and is strongly associated with overall quality of life. Higher income levels provide individuals with better access to resources such as healthcare, education, and social opportunities, which in turn contribute to better physical and psychological well-being. Research has shown that individuals with higher incomes tend to report higher levels of life satisfaction across multiple dimensions, including physical health, mental well-being, and social engagement. According to a study on quality of life and sense of community, people with higher income report enhanced quality of life, including better psychological health and greater social connectedness (Gattino et al., 2013).\n\n\nSource\nACS Variables:\n\nS1903_C03_001\n\nMedian income for all households in the past 12 months (2022 dollars)\n\n\n\n\nCalculation\n\nMeasure taken directly from S1903_C03_001\n\n\n\n\nHouseholds Below Poverty Level (Financial)\n\nMeasure Description\nThis indicator measures the percentage of households with income below the federal poverty level in the past 12 months. Poverty represents a constraint on financial capital, limiting access to essential goods, services, and investments that support economic stability and long-term mobility. Research shows that poverty is causally linked to poorer developmental outcomes in children, particularly in cognitive and educational domains, due to factors such as material hardship, family stress, and limited access to enriching environments (Chaudry & Wimer, 2016). At the household level, poverty reduces the ability to accumulate savings, invest in education or housing, and respond to financial shocks—core dimensions of financial capital (Chetty et al., 2014). The timing, duration, and concentration of poverty—especially in early childhood and across communities—can have lasting impacts on opportunity and economic well-being.\n\n\nSource\nACS Variables:\n\nS1701_C03_001\n\nPopulation for whom poverty status is determined in the past 12 months.\n\n\n\n\nCalculation\n\nMeasure taken directly from S1701_C03_001\n\n\n\n\nGini Index of Income Inequality (Financial)\n\nMeasure Description\nThis indicator measures income inequality within a population using the Gini coefficient, where higher values reflect greater disparity between high- and low-income earners. Income inequality can reduce overall child well-being, regardless of a household’s individual income. Based on (Wilkinson & Pickett, 2007), greater inequality is associated with worse outcomes across multiple child well-being domains—including higher rates of teenage births, infant mortality, low birth weight, juvenile homicide, poor mental health, and school dropout. Societies with larger gaps between rich and poor tend to experience more widespread social and developmental challenges. These findings suggest that income distribution, not just income levels, influences the development of human and financial capital.\n\n\nSource\nACS Variables:\n\nB19083_001\n\nGini index of income inequality\n\n\n\n\nCalculation\n\nMeasure taken directly from B19083_001",

It helps assess the density and accessibility of cultural resources across communities. Cultural participation has been linked to better self-reported health, partly due to its social and emotional benefits (Wilkinson et al., 2007). Attending cultural activities often involves social interaction, which can foster support networks that positively influence health and well-being.\n\nCalculation\nFor our analysis, we focused on the total count of historic sites, museums, public art, monuments, and similar locations, collectively referred to as cultural locations. To assess the distribution of these cultural sites within each city or county, we computed the number of cultural locations per 10,000 people. This measure allows us to compare the availability and density of cultural resources across different areas.\nAfter extracting the relevant data from the website, we tallied the total number of cultural locations for each city or county. To calculate our measure of interest (Cultural_Locations_per_10k), we used the following steps:\n\nExtracted city/county population data from the American Community Survey (ACS).\nDivided the total number of cultural locations in each city/county by the population of the corresponding city/county.\nMultiplied the results by 10,000 to express the number of cultural locations per 10,000 people.\n\nThus, the final measure Cultural_Locations_per_10k was obtained using this formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Cultural\\_Locations\\_per\\_10k} = \\frac{\\text{Total Number of Cultural Locations}}{\\text{Population}} \\times 10,000\n\\]",

A higher percentage of such small businesses is often indicative of a robust entrepreneurial environment. Research demonstrates that communities with a greater concentration of small businesses tend to exhibit better population health outcomes. This relationship is attributed to the role of small businesses in enhancing social capital by fostering local networks, civic engagement, and collective efficacy. Small businesses also contribute to local economic development by creating jobs, retaining wealth within the community, and stimulating economic diversification (Blanchard et al., 2012).\n\n\nCalculation\nThis measure is calculated as the number of businesses that are small (less than or equal to 4 employees) divided by the total number of businesses.\n\\[{\\text{pct\\_small\\_businesses =}}\\frac{\\text{small\\_business\\_count}}{\\text{total\\_business\\_count}}\\]",

It is derived from annual crop acreage reports submitted to the USDA, which detail land use, crop types, and locations. Counties with high cropland percentages may rely heavily on natural resources for economic stability. However, research suggests that natural resource dependence—particularly in rural areas—can be linked to lower long-term economic prosperity and underinvestment in human capital. Monitoring cropland levels is critical not only for resource management and conservation (natural capital), but also for understanding economic risk and financial resilience in agricultural communities (financial capital) (Mueller, 2020).\n\n\nCalculation\ncrop_area: areas of land used for agriculture - crop land, taken from USDA data county_area: areas of the whole counties across the state of Iowa, calculated by using sf package and passing the geometry \\[{\\text{prop\\_crop =}}\\frac{\\text{crop area}}{\\text{county area}}\\]\n\n\n\nValue Per Acre (Natural)\n\nMeasure Description & Calculation\nValue of every acre of agricultural land - crop land, taken from USDA data\nDirectly extract the value per acre from USDA data (value_per_acre).",

It does not include land where an agricultural drainage well has been plugged causing a temporary wetland or land within a drainage district or levee district.\n\nMeasure Description & Calculation\nWetland_Acres_Prop: Calculated the proportion of wetlands acres per county to the total acres per county.\n\\[\\text{Wetland\\_Acres\\_Prop =} \\frac{\\text{Wetland Acres}} {\\text{county area}}\\]\n\n\n\nForestry (Natural)\nThe Iowa Legislature passed a landowner property tax incentive known as the Forest and Fruit Tree Reservation Act (Forest Reserve) in 1906. The act is to reduce or eliminate property taxes to incentive landowners to grow tress on their less fertile or productive land. It is a source of farm income, erosion control, watershed protection and game cover.\n\nMeasure Description & Calculation\nforest_acres_prop_county: Calculated the proportion of forest acres per county to the total acres per county.

    "text": "Measures\n\nEconomic Connectedness (Social)\nThis indicator measures the social ties between individuals of high and low socioeconomic status (SES). This measure is a form of bridging social capital, linking individuals from different social and economic backgrounds. Economic connectedness is a key factor in upward income mobility, as research shows that children from low-SES families in areas with greater economic connectedness have higher income potential. Social connections with well-resourced individuals provide opportunities and pathways to better economic outcomes. The level of economic connectedness is influenced by regional factors, such as the proximity and frequency of interactions between different SES groups (Chetty et al., 2022).\n\n\nChild Economic Connectedness (Social)\nThe level of economic connectedness for children within a county or zip code, indicating economic integration among the younger population.\n\n\nSupport Ratio (Cohesiveness) (Social)\nThis indicator measures the proportion of friendships within a community that share a third mutual friend, serving as an indicator of bonding social capital. This form of social capital reflects the strength and cohesiveness of close-knit relationships within a group. Research shows that strong social ties at both the individual and community levels can promote cooperation and resilience. High levels of social capital can help foster trust and support, which in turn leads to more cooperative actions and a better-functioning community (Poortinga, 2012).\n\n\nVolunteering rate (Social)\nThis indicator reflects the percentage of the population engaged in volunteer activities. Volunteering is a key aspect of civic participation, which has been linked to improved general health and well-being. Volunteering offers benefits not only to organizations and recipients but also to the volunteers themselves. Research shows that volunteering increases self-esteem, self-efficacy, and a sense of community, while also reducing loneliness and improving mental health (Nichol et al., 2023). These social and psychological benefits contribute to lower mortality rates and overall better health outcomes.\n\n\nNumber of Civic Organizations (Social)\nThis indicator reflects the number of civic organizations within a county or city, serving as a measure of community engagement and social infrastructure. Research suggests that greater civic participation and group involvement are linked to improved general and self-reported health, often through increased social cohesion (Almanza et al., 2012). Civic organizations can foster both bonding within groups and bridging across diverse communities, expanding social networks and strengthening community ties.\n\n\nExposure Group Membership (Social)\nThe extent to which individuals in a county or zip code are exposed to group memberships, reflecting social integration and network density.\n\n\nClustering - Percent of friends that are also friends with each other (Social)\nThe average of an individual’s friend pairs who are also friends with one another.",

    "text": "Cultural Locations per 10,000 People (Cultural)\n\nMeasure Description\nThis indicator measures the number of cultural sites—such as museums, monuments, historic landmarks, and public art—per 10,000 residents in a given city or county. It helps assess the density and accessibility of cultural resources across communities. Cultural participation has been linked to better self-reported health, partly due to its social and emotional benefits (Wilkinson et al., 2007). Attending cultural activities often involves social interaction, which can foster support networks that positively influence health and well-being.\n\nCalculation\nFor our analysis, we focused on the total count of historic sites, museums, public art, monuments, and similar locations, collectively referred to as cultural locations. To assess the distribution of these cultural sites within each city or county, we computed the number of cultural locations per 10,000 people. This measure allows us to compare the availability and density of cultural resources across different areas.\nAfter extracting the relevant data from the website, we tallied the total number of cultural locations for each city or county. To calculate our measure of interest (Cultural_Locations_per_10k), we used the following steps:\n\nExtracted city/county population data from the American Community Survey (ACS).\nDivided the total number of cultural locations in each city/county by the population of the corresponding city/county.\nMultiplied the results by 10,000 to express the number of cultural locations per 10,000 people.\n\nThus, the final measure Cultural_Locations_per_10k was obtained using this formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Cultural\\_Locations\\_per\\_10k} = \\frac{\\text{Total Number of Cultural Locations}}{\\text{Population}} \\times 10,000\n\\]",
