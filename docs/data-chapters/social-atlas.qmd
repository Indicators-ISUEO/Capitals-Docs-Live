# Social Capital Atlas {.unnumbered}

## Brief Description

*This information is based on social media data and presence.*

This is a sample of friendship ties for users aged 25-44 in the United
States to construct measures for how communities are connected.

Different measures for social capital in this dataset:

-   Connectedness: How people with different characteristics and
    backgrounds are friends with each other, this is a clear example of
    bridging social capital.
-   Cohesiveness: The degree to which friendship networks are clustered
    into cliques and whether friendships tend to be supported by mutual
    friends. This includes our clustering and support ratio measures.
-   Civic Engagement: Indices of trust or participation in civic
    organizations. This includes our volunteering rate measure.

## Measures

### Economic Connectedness (Social)
This indicator measures the social ties between individuals of high and low socioeconomic status (SES). This measure is a form of bridging social capital, linking individuals from different social and economic backgrounds. Economic connectedness is a key factor in upward income mobility, as research shows that children from low-SES families in areas with greater economic connectedness have higher income potential. Social connections with well-resourced individuals provide opportunities and pathways to better economic outcomes. The level of economic connectedness is influenced by regional factors, such as the proximity and frequency of interactions between different SES groups (Chetty et al., 2022).

### Child Economic Connectedness (Social)
The level of economic connectedness for children within a county or zip code, indicating economic integration among the younger population.

### Support Ratio (Cohesiveness) (Social)
This indicator measures the proportion of friendships within a community that share a third mutual friend, serving as an indicator of bonding social capital. This form of social capital reflects the strength and cohesiveness of close-knit relationships within a group. Research shows that strong social ties at both the individual and community levels can promote cooperation and resilience. High levels of social capital can help foster trust and support, which in turn leads to more cooperative actions and a better-functioning community (Poortinga, 2012).

### Volunteering rate (Social)
This indicator reflects the percentage of the population engaged in volunteer activities. Volunteering is a key aspect of civic participation, which has been linked to improved general health and well-being. Volunteering offers benefits not only to organizations and recipients but also to the volunteers themselves. Research shows that volunteering increases self-esteem, self-efficacy, and a sense of community, while also reducing loneliness and improving mental health (Nichol et al., 2023). These social and psychological benefits contribute to lower mortality rates and overall better health outcomes.

### Number of Civic Organizations (Social)
This indicator reflects the number of civic organizations within a county or city, serving as a measure of community engagement and social infrastructure. Research suggests that greater civic participation and group involvement are linked to improved general and self-reported health, often through increased social cohesion (Almanza et al., 2012). Civic organizations can foster both bonding within groups and bridging across diverse communities, expanding social networks and strengthening community ties.

### Exposure Group Membership (Social)
The extent to which individuals in a county or zip code are exposed to group memberships, reflecting social integration and network density.

### Clustering - Percent of friends that are also friends with each other (Social)
The average of an individual's friend pairs who are also friends with one another.
